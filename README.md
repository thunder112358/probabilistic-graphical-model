I trust this model will have good prospects for development just like deep learning in the future

I have read a book about bayesian network, and this book is written by the statistician. After that, I want to read a book called 《Probabilistic Graphical Models: Principles and Techniques》 written by **Dophne Koller**, and use python to do data analysis.
